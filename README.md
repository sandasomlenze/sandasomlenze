Dear Sir/Madam

I'm Sanda Somlenze, I'm an enthusiastic and detail-oriented Junior-Frontend Software Develpor seeking an entry-level position with Company to use my skills in coding, troubleshooting complex problems, and assisting in the timely completion of projects.

I'm a Junior Front-End Developer with a proven ability to collaborate effectively with senior developers while spending extra time to be mentored. Enjoy working closely with team members to ensure workloads are effectively redirected to bottlenecks and personally picking up the slack when necessary. With a passion for both personal growth and for software development, I attended a 1000+ hour coding bootcamp to learn new languages while sharpening existing skills. Ready to apply my passion for coding to a talented engineering team to develop quality solutions.

Best Regards
